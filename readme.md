# TOAD FRONTEND V1

## Introduction

toad.network was the first delivery that came from they TOAD.Network DEV team.

It is the base layer for the overall ecosystem of utilities built to solve common problems of Decentralized Finance. You can find more details about the project at [ToadNetwork DOCS](https://docs.toad.network)

## About this repository

This is the **Toad-front-end** repository

Contains the code related to the first version of toad.network webpage, which allowed interactions with the OG farms rewarding TOAD and the first version of the amazing DPLP protocol. It is not deleted (and the service remains available too) for both historical reasons and the need to allow users that might have not moved their stakes from old PCS v1 liquidity into the fairer and more advanced farms that were built later on under the padswap ecosystem.

TOAD BSC contract can be checked at The DOCS [here](https://docs.toad.network/reference/contract-addresses#usdtoad-contracts).

## Old service URL

If for any reason you still have some liquidity available on these old farms and cannot manage through BSC Explorer to handle this, you can reach the old site here(https://old.toad.network/)

## ToDo tasks

1. Deprecate and take down the server once the liquidity has been removed from the OLD OG farms (there is still some liquidity there)
2. Ensure that the newest version of the toad UI allows users to "reinvest" using the corresponding button, meanwhile, this UI is the only one that allows this.
